**-gamma** :  Number of iterations for AILS-II to perform a new adjustment of variable ùúî. The default value is 30.

**-dMax** : Initial reference distance between the reference solution and the  solution obtained after the local search. The default value is 30.

**-dMin** : Final Reference distance between the reference solution and the solution obtained after the local search. The default value is 15.
